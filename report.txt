So this assignment was about a webpage(s) related to your Hobby, and it should include multiple webpage with a seamless way to jump accross them, which was done possible with the help of a navigation bar. 


I made in total 3 different pages, each of them linked to each other and then one extra anchor tag in the navbar which can include the link to external social media apps. 


Lets start from the Home page (index.html);

So I went with the generic black and white theme. Added animations to header and the content of the page. I divided the part into 4 sections, 1st is header, then navigation bar then 2 sections represting two different car brands and eventually ending with a footer. 


Now in All Media page (media.html):

I made several cards which include the picture of the car (mostly front pose) and the model and manufacturer of the car. I added a hover animation to make it interactive and stylish. 

Enquiry Form (form.html):

A simple form layout, with 3 text inputs and one list-style option input and a submit button.
